# MadLib

## Project for Advanced Java

This was an assignment for my high school Advanced Java class in November of 2022. It was a project to 
teach us the use of RegEx and Test Driven Development. I chose to do this in the form of a mad lib, 
where the user is given a prompt and they must input something to fulfill that prompt.

Requirements: 
1) 3 tests per variable
2) 3 variables
3) 1 instance per character
4) A unique feature
5) Rioux style
6) Good commit Hygiene
